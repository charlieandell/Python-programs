This program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an ancient algorithm, that finds all prime numbers up to a given number N,
which is inputted by the user. The algorithm works by coutning up through the set of natural numbers that are greater than
two and checking to see which numbers no more than N integer divide by this natural number greater than two. The ones that
do are marked off a list and excluded because they cannot be prime.

Once integer division has been checked for all numbers up to and including N, the program stops, and prints the number which
not integer divide by any number less than it, which are the primes no more than N, as well as how many of these primes there
were.
